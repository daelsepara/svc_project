# SNK vs. Capcom Project

This is a repository for my one-time SNK Vs. Capcom Card Fighter's Clash project for the Gameboy Advance (GBA). It was my incomplete and unfinished entry to the GBAX 2004 competition. 2004... Seems like a lifetime ago now. I don't know if this one still builds or anyone might find interest in it. Programming for the GBA seemed really cool in your 20's. I am uploading what I can salvage from my computer's hard disks for preservation.
